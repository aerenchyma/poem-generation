            <p class="question">Will I get the same poem again if I put in the same word again?</p>
            <p class="answer">No. At least, it's <i>very, very, very</i> unlikely.</p>
       </li>

       <li class="q-and-a">
            <p class="question">Where does the data come from??</p>
            <p class="answer">The <a href="https://github.com/aparrish/gutenberg-poetry-corpus">Gutenberg Poetry Corpus</a>, put together by <a href="https://www.decontextualize.com/">Allison Parrish</a></p>
       </li>

       <li class="q-and-a">
            <p class="question">Why doesn't my poem have the word I put in in it / rhyme with the word I put in anywhere / seem to have anything to do with the word I put in?</p>
            <p class="answer">The word you put in to this site simply <i>inspires</i> the generator &mdash; no promises as to how that shows up in the result.</p>
       </li>

        <li class="q-and-a">
            <p class="question">Why does it take so long?</p>
            <p class="answer">Like it says, art takes time.</p>
        </li>

        <li class="q-and-a">
            <p class="question">Why isn't there {insert thing you think the site should have} ?</p>
            <p class="answer">Either because I didn't make that happen yet, or because I'm not going to. If you know me personally feel free to make a suggestion, though! I'll probably continue adding features as long as it's still fun.</p>
