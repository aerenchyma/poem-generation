# NaPoGenMo ~2021~ 2022

This was originally an entry for [NaPoGenMo 2021](https://github.com/NaPoGenMo/NaPoGenMo2021). It's now an entry for [NaPoGenMo 2022](todo), with the caveat that I started it in 2021.

The day I got my second COVID vaccine in April 2021, I lay around on the couch and started building this. But I got tired... Then I bought a new computer for myself in early 2022 and thought this would be fun to return to this year. Including an excellent lesson in memory consumption, the whole process has been a delight.

I strongly recommend the poems aloud dramatically -- it makes them sound good (...most of the time).

You can see and interact with it [here](). [TODO link -- working on productionalizing it!]

## tl;dr

This is basically a bunch of awesome and fun tools built by [Allison Parrish](https://www.decontextualize.com/), repackaged and amended in various ways for this particular use. Very grateful for the availability of all this cool stuff she's shared.

Also major thanks to [Liza Daly](https://lizadaly.com/) who suggested I try NaPoGenMo in the first place.

Highly recommend checking out both their work. Both of them remind me why I like computers.
