# Stanza Extravaganza

This is a website that creates poems based on single-word inspiration any site visitor can input.

## NaPoGenMo ~2021~ 2022

This was originally an entry for [NaPoGenMo 2021](https://github.com/NaPoGenMo/NaPoGenMo2021).

I strongly recommend the poems aloud dramatically -- it makes them sound good (...most of the time).

You can see and interact with it [here](https://stanza-extravaganza.herokuapp.com/). 

If you have problems, please let me know or open an issue on the repo! Not promising to fix everything, but I'm definitely curious.

## story 

The day I got my second COVID vaccine in April 2021, I lay around on the couch and started building this. But I got tired... Then I bought a new computer for myself in early 2022 and thought this would be fun to return to this year. Including an excellent lesson in memory consumption, the whole process has been a delight.

The code itself is still a little messy ("oh right that's why we typically use linters"), so please ignore. In my defense, I wrote a decent chunk of it while pretty sleepy.

## tl;dr

This is basically a bunch of awesome and fun tools built by [Allison Parrish](https://www.decontextualize.com/), repackaged and amended in various ways for this particular use. Very grateful for the availability of all this cool stuff she's built and shared.

Also major thanks to [Liza Daly](https://lizadaly.com/) who suggested I try NaPoGenMo in the first place.

Highly recommend checking out both their work. Both of them remind me why I like computers.
